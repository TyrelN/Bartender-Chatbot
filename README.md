## 310 Assignment 3: Bartender Chatbot

## Introduction
For this assignment, we built a chat bot to mimic basic bartending needs. Built with basic functionality that can accept a text entry and respond with a logical statement. Our bot uses pattern matching and recognizes “aggressive” words instead of adapting a more complex contextual recognition approach. The app is accessible through Facebook and can be easily interacted with through the messenger.

## Libraries
* NLTK/TextBlob - Python framework used for natural language processing
* Flask - Python web framework used to communicate with POST requests
* Spell.py - Simple spell checker

```
## Running
Once installed, run flask and node as background processes.
```console
user@server:~$ python3 bartender
```
Then, browse to http://127.0.0.1:8090 to access the bot.

Alternatively, a live demo can be accessed at https://chatbot.coremachine.xyz
